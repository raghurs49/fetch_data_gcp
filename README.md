# fetch_data_gcp
We are copying the notebooks folder consisting of python notebook for ingesting data from GCS to BQ. Here we are using the service account and github pipeline.
So the data will be copied in a bucket in dev/pqt/prod project, there we can copy manually into the workbench from GCS bucket(where noteboko is already stored).
